# Django-Blog
This is Blog website in Django made by me. It includes all the advanced functionalitites that a blog can have, from logging into the platform, to adding comments, subscribing to the RSS feed, to sharing the posts.

Home page:

Post detail:

The panel to the right contains links for subscribing to the RSS feed and lists of "latest posts" and the "most commented posts".
Clicking on the "Subscribe to my RSS feed" button generates the following RSS link:
